# SortingAlgorithms

This is a school project for Practical work (Harjoitusty√∂) course in University of Turku. The project is coded with C# as it was mutual interest within the group to learn a new programming language. Also C# is fairly close to Java which both of us had earlier experience with.

## Purpose

You can compare different sorting algorithms' performance with this program. There's three sorting algorithms implemented (bubblesort, heapsort and quicksort). The program calculates how long it takes to sort a list of user chosen length. The sorting is repeated 30 times to minimize chance variation. Average running time of sort is then calculated to approximate the running time of individual sort.
